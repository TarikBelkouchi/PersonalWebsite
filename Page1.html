                I've never blogged once in my life. I always kinda thought it was lame. Like just make a video Bozo! Vlogging is definetly the way of the future. I'm not even really into that. I'd rather share my thoughts and opnions with people I know and value. Not the 45 weirdos who would possibly watch my vlog/ read my blog.

                Alot of people go through a rough time developing. My teenage years were quite easy. I've been the same hieght since I was about 14. Which was cool for the most part, since I still have shirts and hoodies from high school. I guess the toughest part watching all my friends get taller than me adventuelly and waiting for my time that never came.

                I was born in Bellvue hospital in NYC. My mom always told me that it was was known for being an insane asylum until a few months before I was born. I lived in Astoria Queens till I was about 9 years old. My dad stayed so I still always visit for most of my later years. I've always planned on moving back to queens and hope that my future career paths can lead me back home.
